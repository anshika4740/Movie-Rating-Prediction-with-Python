# Movie-Rating-Prediction-with-Python
This project aims to predict movie ratings using a Kaggle dataset by applying Python-based data science techniques. It involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, and building predictive models using machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest. The model predicts user ratings based on features like user behavior, movie genres, and historical data. Evaluation metrics like RMSE and RÂ² score are used to assess model performance. This project demonstrates the practical application of regression techniques in recommender systems.
